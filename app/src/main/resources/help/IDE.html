    <h3>RARS - RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator</h3>
    <h4>Using RARS through its Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h4>
</center>
The IDE is invoked when RARS is run with no command arguments, e.g. <tt>java -jar rars.jar</tt>. It may also be launched
from a graphical interface by double-clicking the <tt>rars.jar</tt> icon that represents this executable JAR file. The
IDE provides basic editing, assembling and execution capabilities. Hopefully it is intuitive to use. Here are comments
on some features.
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Menus and Toolbar</b>: Most menu items have equivalent toolbar icons. If the function of a toolbar icon is
        not obvious, just hover the mouse over it and a tool tip will soon appear. Nearly all menu items also have
        keyboard shortcuts. Any menu item not appropriate in a given situation is disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Editor</b>: RARS includes two integrated text editors. The default editor features syntax-aware color
        highlighting of most language elements and popup instruction guides. The original, generic, text editor without
        these features is still available and can be selected in the Editor Settings dialog. It supports a single font
        which can be modified in the Editor Settings dialog. The bottom border of either editor includes the cursor line
        and column position and there is a checkbox to display line numbers. They are displayed outside the editing
        area. If you use an external editor, RARS provides a convenience setting that will automatically assemble a file
        as soon as it is opened. See the Settings menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Message Areas</b>: There are three tabbed message areas at the bottom of the screen. <br> The <i>Messages</i>
        tab is used for messages such as assembly or runtime errors and informational messages. You can click on
        assembly error messages to select the corresponding line of code in the editor. <br> The <i>Run I/O</i> tab is
        used at runtime for displaying console output and entering console input. In that tab, you have three options to
        choose from.
        <ul>
            <li>Popups : You enter console input into a pop-up dialog that echoes to the message area. The output also
                appears in that message area.
            </li>
            <li>Interactive : You enter console input directly into the message area. The output also appears in the
                same message area.
            </li>
            <li>Batch : The message area is separated into two windows. The first one (left) takes the whole input that
                you want for the program execution. The second one (right) will show the output. During execution, the
                input will be read from the first window, character by character, as if you entered those manually one
                by one in the interactive option when the program was asking for an entry. You have to be careful to
                respect how the input is taken by the program. For example, Syscall ReadInt reads until there is a <tt>'\n'</tt>
                to terminate the entry, so you have to put a line break after the number for that entry.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The <i>Program Arguments</i> tab is used to provide arguments to the program. If that message area is used, a0
        (argc) will then be initialised to the number of arguments provided, a1 (argv) will contain the address of an
        argv array (the argv array is of size argc). This array will contain pointers to Strings corresponding to each
        argument provided.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Registers</b>: Registers are displayed at all times, even when you are editing and not running a program.
        While writing your program, this serves as a useful reference for register names and their conventional uses
        (hover mouse over the register name to see tool tips). There are three register tabs: the Register File (integer
        registers $0 through $31 plus LO, HI and the Program Counter), selected Coprocesor 0 registers (exceptions and
        interrupts), and Coprocessor 1 floating point registers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Assembly</b>: Select <i>Assemble</i> from the <i>Run</i> menu or the corresponding toolbar icon to assemble
        the file currently in the Edit tab. With the Assemble All setting turned on the assembler will assemble the
        current file as the "main" program and also assemble all other assembly files (*.asm; *.s) in the same
        directory. And with the Assemble Open option, currently open the assembler will also assemble currently open
        files. The results are linked and if all these operations were successful the program can be executed. Labels
        that are declared global with the ".globl" directive may be referenced in any of the other files in the project.
        There is also a setting that permits automatic loading and assembly of a selected exception handler file.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Execution</b>: Once a program successfully assembles, the registers are initialized and three windows in the
        Execute tab are filled: <i>Text Segment</i>, <i>Data Segment</i>, and <i>Program Labels</i>. The major
        execution-time features are described below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Labels Window</b>: Display of the Labels window (symbol table) is controlled through the Settings menu. When
        displayed, you can click on any label or its associated address to center and highlight the contents of that
        address in the Text Segment window or Data Segment window as appropriate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The assembler and simulator are invoked from the IDE when you select the <i>Assemble</i>, <i>Go</i>, or <i>Step</i>
    operations from the <i>Run</i> menu or their corresponding toolbar icons or keyboard shortcuts. RARS messages are
    displayed on the <i>RARS Messages</i> tab of the message area at the bottom of the screen. Runtime console input and
    output is handled in the <i>Run I/O</i> tab.
